# GifTastic

This is a GIF generator app that populates the page with GIFs from giphy.com when you click a GIF button. 

## Getting started

To get started go to   https://funkedee.github.io/GifTastic/.
Then click a GIF button at the top of the page to see 10 GIFs of the topic on the button and their rating. The page loads with animal themed buttons but you can also make a new button of your own topic by filling in the blank input under "Add a new GIF button" and clicking submit.  Then click any GIF to play it, click again to pause it.
